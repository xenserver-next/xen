# 05 - xen/domctl: add XEN_DOMCTL_set_memory_claims

**Result:** the code is correct.

## Code review

- Domain lookup: the op takes the `default:` path of `do_domctl()`, so `d`
  comes from `rcu_lock_domain_by_id()` and is never NULL. System domains
  are not found (ESRCH). The XSM check `xsm_domctl(XSM_PRIV, d, op)` runs
  before `domctl_lock_acquire()`, and the handler runs under the domctl
  lock.
- The checks are stable while the handler runs. `domain_kill()` sets
  `is_dying` and releases the claims under the domctl lock ("Protected by
  domctl_lock" in `domain.c`). `controller_pause_count` changes only
  through domctls (`pausedomain`, `unpausedomain`, gdbsx) and at boot.
  This settles the open point from patch 4: no claim can be installed
  after `domain_kill()` released them, so `outstanding_claims` and
  `d->claims` cannot leak.
- Release: `nr_entries == 0` calls `domain_set_outstanding_pages(d, 0)`
  before the state checks. For a dying domain whose claims `domain_kill()`
  already released, `d->node_claims == 0`. The release loop of patch 2
  then stops before it reads `d->claims[]`, so the NULL array is never
  dereferenced.
- Install: `nr_entries` is bounded by `MAX_NUMNODES + 1` before the
  allocation, and the entries are copied into a Xen buffer, which settles
  the second open point from patch 4. The buffer is freed on all paths
  after it is allocated.
- The `domctl.h` errno list matches the code entry by entry, including
  both `pad` fields, `tot_pages > max_pages` (EINVAL), the
  `MAX_NUMNODES`-based E2BIG, and "fails without changing the claims".
  "Paused" means `controller_pause_count`, as for `XEN_DOMINF_paused`.
- Compared with `XENMEM_claim_pages`: LLC coloring returns EOPNOTSUPP in
  both (this op still allows the release). A dying domain gets ESRCH for
  an install, and EINVAL from the legacy op.
- XSM: dummy `xsm_domctl()` falls to `xsm_default_action(XSM_PRIV, ...)`.
  `flask_claim_pages(d)` checks `domain2:setclaim`. `tools/flask/policy`
  already grants `setclaim` in `create_domain_common`, and
  `docs/misc/xsm-flask.txt` covers all domctls not listed as safe, so no
  policy or doc change is needed.
- ABI: `xen_domctl_memory_claims` is 8 + 4 + 4 bytes without implicit
  padding. Command 91 follows 90. The `domctl.h` header says pure
  additions need no interface-version bump. `domctl.c` includes
  `<xen/llc-coloring.h>` and `<xen/xvmalloc.h>`.
- Mechanics: subject 44 characters, body within 72, no trailing
  whitespace, tags in order.

## Questions

## Considered, not edited

- In `set_memory_claims()`, `struct claim_set request = {};` could be
  `struct claim_set request = { .nr_entries = op->nr_entries };`,
  replacing the assignment after the checks. `get_memory_claims()` clamps
  `op->nr_entries` first, so it keeps `= {}` and an assignment. Keeping
  both handlers alike is fine. Taste.

- The errno list is not in the order of the checks. EINVAL and ENOMEM
  each come from several checks, so a list in check order would suggest
  a precedence that the code does not have.
