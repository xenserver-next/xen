# 08 - libxc: add xc_domain_get_memory_claims()

**Result:** the code is correct.

## Code review

- `DECLARE_HYPERCALL_BOUNCE(..., XC_HYPERCALL_BUFFER_BOUNCE_OUT)` sizes the
  buffer from the input capacity `*nr`, so `nr` must not be NULL, which the
  in/out contract in `xenctrl.h` implies. Nothing is copied in.
- `claims == NULL` skips the bounce (`xc__hypercall_bounce_pre()`), so
  `*nr == 0` with `claims == NULL` is the count query. Xen returns 0 and
  `*nr == 0` for a domain without claims, or ENOBUFS and the count.
- `struct xen_domctl domctl = {}` zeroes `pad`. libxc's `do_domctl()`
  bounces the domctl in both directions, also on failure, and Xen sets
  `copyback` on success, ENOBUFS and EFAULT (patch 7), so `*nr` is the
  count after these. After an early failure (ESRCH, EPERM, EINVAL, ENOMEM)
  Xen does not copy back, so `*nr` keeps the input capacity.
- `HYPERCALL_BOUNCE_SET_SIZE(claims, ret ? 0 : sizeof(*claims) * *nr)`
  copies back nothing on failure and only the returned entries on
  success, so "claims is not modified" holds on ENOBUFS. On success, Xen
  returned at most the clamped capacity, so the copy stays within the
  bounce buffer. `xencall_free_buffer()` frees by the page count stored in
  its header, so the smaller size is safe. Precedent for adjusting the size
  before the post call: `xc_misc.c` and the affinity wrappers.
- The 32-bit wrap of `sizeof(*claims) * *nr` was accepted earlier
  (LGM-10). Xen writes at most `MAX_NUMNODES + 1` entries, which fit in
  the page that the allocation header always uses.
- `xenctrl.h`: the comment documents the in/out `*nr`, ENOBUFS, "claims is
  not modified" and the count query. The order of the entries stays in
  `domctl.h`, as the `code-review` skill asks. The prototype needs three
  lines, because `xen_domctl_memory_claim_t *claims, uint32_t *nr);` after
  the open parenthesis would end at column 81. The set prototype is laid
  out the same way.
- CHANGELOG.md: the new sub-item follows the set item and fits in 74
  columns.
- Mechanics: subject 40 characters, body within 72, `git show --check`
  clean, tags in order.
