# 02 - xen/mm: release per-node claims in domain_set_outstanding_pages()

## Code review

- The release loop stops once `d->node_claims` is 0, before it reads
  `d->claims[node]`, so it never dereferences a NULL `d->claims`.
  `ASSERT(!d->node_claims)` after the loop checks the cached sum against
  the entries, and the ASSERT()s before the subtractions state that
  per-node claims are part of `d->outstanding_pages` and
  `node_claimed_pages[node]`.
- A node goes offline only in the error path of x86 `memory_add()`, before
  any of its memory reached the heap, so it cannot hold a claim (to
  confirm with the claim checks of patch 4). Hence, `for_each_online_node`
  visits every node that can hold a claim.
- `d->outstanding_pages` includes the per-node claims, so the existing
  `outstanding_claims -= d->outstanding_pages` releases them as well. The
  `d->claims[]` entries need not be cleared because the array is freed.
  The function detaches `d->claims` under both locks and frees it after
  dropping them, because `xvfree()` can take `heap_lock`. `xvfree(NULL)`
  is fine on the paths that do not detach.
- `domain_kill()` calls `domain_set_outstanding_pages(d, 0)`, so a dying
  domain loses its array before `free_domain_struct()`. Installing claims
  on a dying domain must be refused by the later installer (check at
  patch 5: the domctl runs under `domctl_lock` like `domain_kill()`).
- "No functional change" holds: without per-node claims, the loop exits
  at once, and `d->claims` stays NULL.
- In this patch, `alloc_heap_pages()` still reduces `d->outstanding_pages`
  without reducing per-node claims, which would break the ASSERT()s once
  claims exist. Nothing installs them before patch 5, so every commit is
  correct, as the cover letter says ("no functional effect until patch 5").
- `struct domain`: `node_claims` fills the 4-byte hole that patch 1 added
  before `claims` (see 01), so the default layout has no hole now.
- Style: `for_each_online_node ( node )` like `for_each_vcpu ( d, v )`,
  `node` declared in the block that uses it, lines within 80 columns.
- Commit message: subject 66 characters, body within 72, no trailing
  whitespace, tags in order.
- Builds for x86_64 (debug, FLASK).

## Decisions

- The loop ends once `d->node_claims` reaches 0, so `ASSERT(!d->node_claims)`
  misses entries left on later nodes if the cached sum equals the sum of
  the earlier entries. Visiting every node would need a separate NULL
  check of `d->claims`, and the old helpers had the same limit.
  - The author decided that there is no need to check all entries.
