/*
 * Functional system test suite for testing memory claims in Xen.
 *
 * It is designed to test the xc_domain_claim_memory() API and
 * to reconfirm the xc_domain_claim_pages() API and interacts
 * with the running Xen hypervisor in Dom0 using libxenctrl.
 *
 * The verifications performed by the test cases include:
 *
 * - Validating that claims can be successfully made with valid parameters
 *   and that they have the expected effects on the system's memory state,
 *   such as increasing the number of outstanding claimed pages.
 *
 * - Validating that invalid claim attempts are rejected with the expected
 *   error codes, such as EINVAL for invalid parameters or ENOMEM when
 *   claiming more pages than are free.
 *
 * - Validating the effects of memory claims on the system, such as blocking
 *   effects when claiming more pages than are free or left unclaimed by
 *   other domains, and the guarantees provided by claims such as reserved
 *   claimed pages not being allocated to other domains.
 *
 * For the need to perform these verifications, the test cases interact
 * with the Xen hypervisor to query the system's memory state, create and
 * destroy test domains, perform claim operations, and populate memory to
 * test the blocking effects of claims.
 *
 * As the act of testing the blocking effects of claims involves allocating
 * memory from the system, other operations that interact with the system's
 * memory state should be avoided or kept to a minimum during the test run
 * to avoid interference with the test results.
 *
 * During these interactions, the test cases record successes and failures
 * with detailed messages that include the current step, test parameters,
 * and a snapshot of relevant memory state to aid in diagnosing issues
 * when a test fails.
 *
 * The test suite also ensures that domains are destroyed after tests to
 * clean up claims and leave the system in a clean state, even if a test
 * fails partway through.
 *
 * Some test cases that require multiple NUMA nodes can be skipped if the
 * system does not have a 2nd NUMA node, allowing the test suite to be run
 * on single-node systems as well.
 *
 * It is designed to run on a quiet system as it stakes claims on the system's
 * memory and verifies their effects, by allocating against the running system
 * Xen hypervisor in Dom0 using libxenctrl.
