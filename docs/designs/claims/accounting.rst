   Claims accounting state is only updated while holding :c:expr:`heap_lock`.
   See :ref:`designs/claims/accounting:Locking of claims accounting`
   for details on the locks used to protect claims accounting state.

This section formalizes the internal state and invariants that Xen must
maintain to ensure correctness.

For readers following the design in order, the preceding sections are:

1. :doc:`/designs/claims/design` introduces the overall model and goals.
2. :doc:`/designs/claims/installation` explains how claim sets are installed.
3. :doc:`/designs/claims/protection` describes how claimed memory is
   protected during allocation.
4. :doc:`/designs/claims/redeeming` explains how claims are redeemed as
   allocations succeed.

Total claims and available memory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 These variables tracking the total claims and available memory in the system
 are aggregates of the actual per-node and per-domain values.

 They are only maintained for efficient checks in the allocator hot paths to
 quickly determine if an allocation can be satisfied from unclaimed memory or
 if further checks are needed to determine if the claims of the domain
 can be used to free up memory for the allocation, and to ensure that the
 sum of all claims never exceed the total free memory in the system.

 The number of unclaimed pages across all nodes in the system is derived
 :c:expr:`total_avail_pages` minus :c:expr:`outstanding_claims`.
 This number is then used to:

 - Permit allocation requests if they can be satisfied from unclaimed pages.
 - Ensure that the sum of all claims never exceeds the total free memory.

 .. c:var:: unsigned long total_avail_pages

   Total available pages in the system across all NUMA nodes.
   It is the aggregate of the per-node available pages:
   :c:expr:`total_avail_pages` = SUM(:c:expr:`node_avail_pages[node]`)

 .. c:var:: unsigned long outstanding_claims

   The total sum of all claims across all domains. This is the aggregate of the per-node and floating claims across all domains:
   :c:expr:`outstanding_claims` =
   SUM(:c:expr:`domain.floating_claims`) + SUM(:c:expr:`domain.node_claims`)

Per-node claims and available memory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 .. c:var:: unsigned long node_avail_pages[MAX_NUMNODES]

   Available pages for each NUMA node, including both free and claimed pages.
   This is used for validating that node claims do not exceed the available
   memory on the respective NUMA node.

 .. c:var:: unsigned long node_outstanding_claims[MAX_NUMNODES]

   The total claims across all domains for each NUMA node, indexed by node
   ID. This is maintained for efficient checks in the allocator hot paths.

This diagram illustrates the claims accounting state and the invariants:

Claims accounting state for each domain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 .. c:struct:: domain

   The main structure representing a domain in Xen. It includes the
   claims accounting state for the domain, including both floating
   and node-specific claims, as well as the maximum page limits for the
   domain and the lock protecting the domain's page allocation counts.

   While the domain's page counts are currently `unsigned int`, work to
   change them to `unsigned long` for supporting larger page counts beyond
   16 TB is in progress. The code is designed to already anticipate this
   change and work with either `unsigned int` or `unsigned long` page counts
   equally well.

   .. c:member:: unsigned int floating_claims

      The domain's floating claim, representing the number of pages claimed
      for the domain which are not bound to specific NUMA nodes and which
      can be satisfied using free memory from any node.

      This is used for compatibility with existing :term:`domain builders`
      and for use cases where a domain is not NUMA-affine.
      This can also be desirable when the domain builder needs some
      fallback to non-preferred nodes when the memory on the preferred
      nodes is not sufficient to cover all of its needs, but the host's
      memory pool has sufficient free memory to cover the node's shortfall.

   .. c:member:: unsigned int node_claims

      The total of the domain's node claims, equal to the sum of
      :c:expr:`claims` for all nodes.
      It is maintained for efficient checks in the allocator hot paths
      without needing to sum over the per-node claims each time.

   .. c:member:: unsigned int claims[MAX_NUMNODES]

      The domain's claims for each :term:`NUMA node`, indexed by node ID.

      As :c:expr:`domain` is allocated using a dedicated page for each domain,
      this allows for efficient and fast storage with direct indexing without
      consuming any additional memory for an additional allocation.

      The page allocated for struct :c:expr:`domain` is large enough
      to accommodate this array several times, even beyond the current
      :c:expr:`MAX_NUMNODES` limit of 64, so it should be sufficient even
      for future expansion of the maximum number of supported NUMA nodes
      if needed. The allocation has a build-time assertion for safety to
      ensure that struct :c:expr:`domain` fits within the allocated page.

      The sum of these claims is stored in :c:expr:`domain.node_claims`
      for efficient checks in the allocator hot paths which need to know
      the total number of node claims for the :term:`domain`.

   .. c:member:: unsigned int max_pages

      The maximum number of pages the domain is allowed to claim, set at
      domain creation time.

   .. c:member:: rspinlock_t page_alloc_lock

      Lock for checking :c:expr:`domain_tot_pages(domain)` on top of new claims
      against :c:expr:`domain.max_pages` when installing these new claims.
      This is a recursive spinlock to allow for nested calls into the allocator
      while holding it, such as when redeeming claims during page allocation.
      It is taken before :c:expr:`heap_lock` when installing claims to ensure a
      consistent locking order and may not be taken while holding
      :c:expr:`heap_lock` to avoid deadlocks.

   .. c:member:: nodemask_t node_affinity

      A :c:expr:`nodemask_t` representing the set of NUMA nodes the domain
      is affine to. This is used for efficient checks in the allocator hot
      paths to quickly get the set of nodes a domain is affine to for
      memory allocation decisions.

Claims accounting invariants
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Xen must maintain the following invariants at all times to ensure correctness
of claims accounting:

 - For all claims, including floating claims:
    :c:expr:`outstanding_claims` :math:`\le` :c:expr:`total_avail_pages`

 - For node-specific claims:
    :c:expr:`node_outstanding_claims[alloc_node]` :math:`\le`
    :c:expr:`node_avail_pages[alloc_node]`

 - For all claims:
    :c:expr:`domain.floating_claims` + :c:expr:`domain.node_claims` +
    :c:expr:`domain_tot_pages(domain)` :math:`\le` :c:expr:`domain.max_pages`

    See :doc:`redeeming` for more information on this invariant.

Locking of claims accounting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 .. c:alias:: domain.page_alloc_lock

 .. c:var:: spinlock_t heap_lock

   Lock for all heap operations including claims. It protects the claims state
   and invariants from concurrent updates and ensures that checks in the
   allocator hot paths see a consistent view of the claims state.

   If :c:expr:`domain.page_alloc_lock` is needed to check
   :c:expr:`domain_tot_pages(domain)` on top of new claims against
   :c:expr:`domain.max_pages` for the domain, it needs to be taken
   before :c:expr:`heap_lock` for consistent locking order to avoid deadlocks.

Constants
^^^^^^^^^

 .. c:macro:: MAX_NUMNODES

   The maximum number of NUMA nodes supported by Xen. Used for validating
   node IDs in the :c:expr:`memory_claim_t` entries of claim sets.
   When Xen is built without NUMA support, it is 1.
   The default on x86_64 is 64 which is sufficient for current hardware and
   allows for efficient storage of e.g. the :c:expr:`node_online_map` for
   online nodes and :c:expr:`domain.node_affinity` in a single 64-bit value,
   and in the :c:expr:`domain.claims[MAX_NUMNODES]` array.

   ``xen/arch/Kconfig`` limits the maximum number of NUMA nodes to 64. While
   Xen can be compiled for up to 254 nodes, configuring machines to split
   the installed memory into more than 64 nodes would be unusual.
   For example, dual-socket servers, even when using multiple chips per CPU
   package should typically be configured for 2 NUMA nodes by default.

 .. c:var:: nodemask_t node_online_map

   A bitmap representing which NUMA nodes are currently online in the system.
   This is used for validating that claims are only made for online nodes and
   for efficient checks in the allocator hot paths to quickly determine which
   nodes are online. Currently, Xen does not support hotplug of NUMA nodes,
   so this is set at boot time based on the platform firmware configuration
   and does not change at runtime.

Types
^^^^^

 .. c:type:: uint8_t nodeid_t

   Type for :term:`NUMA node` IDs. The :c:expr:`memflags` variable of
   :c:expr:`xc_populate_physmap()` and related functions for populating
   the :term:`physmap` allocates 8 bits in the flags for the node ID, which
   limits the theoretical maximum value of ``CONFIG_NR_NUMA_NODES`` at 254,
   which is far beyond the current maximum of 64 supported by Xen and should
   be sufficient for the foreseeable future.

 .. c:type:: nodemask_t

   A bitmap representing a set of NUMA nodes, used for status information
   like :c:expr:`node_online_map` and the :c:expr:`domain.node_affinity`
   and to track which nodes are online and which nodes are in a domain's
   node affinity.

Helper functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 .. c:function:: inline unsigned int domain_tot_pages(struct domain *d)

   :param d: The domain for which to calculate the total pages.
   :type d: struct domain *
   :returns: The total pages allocated to the domain.

   This function is used for validating that an allocation and the domain's
   claims do not exceed :c:expr:`domain.max_pages`.
