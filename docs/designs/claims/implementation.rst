.. note:: This part describes implementation details of claims and their
    interaction with memory allocation in Xen. It covers the functions and
    data structures involved in installing claims, allocating memory with
    claims, and handling related edge cases.

Functions related to the implementation of claims and their interaction
with memory allocation.

**********************
Installation of claims
**********************

Installation of legacy claims and claim sets for domains is performed via
the ``xenmem`` hypercall command ``XENMEM_claim_pages`` and the ``domctl``
command ``XEN_DOMCTL_claim_memory``. These are implemented in
``domain_set_outstanding_pages()`` and ``domain_set_node_claims()``.

See:

- :ref:`XENMEM_claim_pages` for details on the legacy claim installation path
- :ref:`XEN_DOMCTL_claim_memory` for details on the claim set installation path

domain_set_outstanding_pages()
------------------------------

.. c:function:: int domain_set_outstanding_pages(struct domain *d, \
                                                 unsigned int nr_claims, \
                                                 memory_claim_t *claims)

    :param d: The domain for which to set the outstanding claims
    :param nr_claims: The number of claims in the claim set
    :param claims: The claim set to install for the domain
    :type claims: memory_claim_t *
    :type d: struct domain *
    :type nr_claims: unsigned int
    :returns: 0 on success, or a negative error code on failure.

    This function takes the necessary locks for installing claims,
    implements the legacy claim installation path for ``XENMEM_claim_pages``,
    and forwards claim set installations for ``XEN_DOMCTL_claim_memory``
    to the internal function ``domain_set_node_claims()``.

domain_set_node_claims()
------------------------

``domain_set_node_claims()`` is the internal function to handle installing
claim sets for a domain. It performs the full validation of the claim set
and updates the domain's node claims accordingly if the claim set is valid.

It is called by ``domain_set_outstanding_pages()`` after acquiring the
necessary locks for installing claim sets.

.. c:function:: int domain_set_node_claims(struct domain *d, \
                                           unsigned int nr_claims, \
                                           memory_claim_t *claims)

    :param d: The domain for which to set the node claims
    :param nr_claims: The number of claims in the claim set
    :param claims: The claim set to install for the domain
    :type claims: memory_claim_t *
    :type d: struct domain *
    :type nr_claims: unsigned int
    :returns: 0 on success, or a negative error code on failure.

    This function validates the provided claim set and, if valid, updates
    the domain's claiming state. It performs full input validation and
    ensures claims do not exceed the domain's maximum page limits. If the
    claims are valid but cannot be satisfied due to insufficient memory,
    it returns an appropriate error code.

    The function works in four phases:

     1. Validating claim entries and checking node-local availability
     2. Validating total claims and checking global availability
     3. Resetting any current claims of the domain
     4. Installing the claim set as the domain's claiming state

    Phase 1 checks claim entries for validity and memory availability:

     1. Target must be ``XEN_DOMCTL_CLAIM_MEMORY_GLOBAL`` or an online node.
     2. Each target node may only appear once in the claim set.
     3. For node-local claims, requested pages must not exceed the available
        memory on that node after accounting for existing claims.
     4. The explicit padding field must be zero for forward compatibility.

    Phase 2 checks:

     1. The sum of claims must not exceed globally available memory.
     2. The claims must not exceed the domain's ``max_pages`` limit.
        See :doc:`accounting` and :doc:`consumption` for the accounting
        checks that enforce the domain's ``max_pages`` limit.

************************************
Helper functions for managing claims
************************************

``release_global_claims()`` and ``release_node_claim()`` are helper
functions used to release claims from domains when necessary:

- :ref:`designs/claims/implementation:consume_allocation()`
  uses them for consuming claims after an allocation.
- :ref:`designs/claims/implementation:unset_node_claims()`
  uses them for resetting claims when resetting the claiming state.
- :ref:`designs/claims/implementation:reserve_offlined_page()`
  uses them for recalling claims when offlining pages reduces
  available memory below the currently claimed memory. See
  :ref:`designs/claims/implementation:Offlining memory in presence of claims`
  for further information.

release_global_claims()
-----------------------

.. c:function:: unsigned long release_global_claims(struct domain *d, \
                                                    unsigned long release)

    :param d: The domain for which to release the global claim
    :param release: The number of pages to release
    :type d: struct domain *
    :type release: unsigned long
    :returns: The number of pages actually released from the global claim.

    This function releases the specified number of globally claimed pages
    and updates the global outstanding totals accordingly.

release_node_claim()
--------------------

.. c:function:: unsigned long release_node_claim(struct domain *d, \
                                                 nodeid_t node, \
                                                 unsigned long release)

    :param d: The domain for which to release the node claim
    :param node: The node for which to release the claim
    :param release: The number of pages to release from the claim
    :type d: struct domain *
    :type node: nodeid_t
    :type release: unsigned long
    :returns: The number of pages actually released from the claim

    This function releases a specified number of pages from a domain's
    claim on a specific node. It limits the release to the amount of
    claims currently held by the domain on that node, and it updates the
    global and node-level outstanding claims accordingly.

unset_node_claims()
-------------------

.. c:function:: void unset_node_claims(struct domain *d)

    :param d: The domain for which to unset the node claims.
    :type d: struct domain *

    This function is used by
    :ref:`designs/claims/implementation:domain_set_outstanding_pages()`
    to reset node-local parts of the domain's claiming state.

**********************
Allocation with claims
**********************

The functions below play a key role in allocating memory for domains.

populate_physmap()
------------------

``libxenguest``'s ``meminit`` API calls ``xc_domain_populate_physmap()``
for populating the guest's physmap, which invokes the restartable
``XENMEM_populate_physmap`` hypercall handled by this function.

During domain creation, this function adds the ``MEMF_no_scrub`` flag to
the allocation request, so the buddy allocator may return unscrubbed pages,
which are scrubbed before being added to the physmap of the domain.

If the allocation request carries a NUMA node hint or the domain has NUMA
node affinity, the allocator may return unscrubbed pages from that node
without switching nodes to find already-scrubbed ones.

Domain builders can optimise on-demand scrubbing by running physmap
population pinned to the domain's NUMA node, keeping scrubbing local and
avoiding cross-node traffic.

.. c:function:: void populate_physmap(struct memop_args *a)

    :param a: Provides status and hypercall restart info
    :type a: struct memop_args *

    Allocates memory for building a domain and uses it for populating
    the domain's physmap. For allocation, it uses ``alloc_domheap_pages()``,
    which forwards the request to ``alloc_heap_pages()``.

alloc_heap_pages()
------------------

.. c:function:: struct page_info *alloc_heap_pages(unsigned int zone_lo, \
                                                   unsigned int zone_hi, \
                                                   unsigned int order, \
                                                   unsigned int memflags, \
                                                   struct domain *d)

    :param zone_lo: The lowest zone index to consider for allocation
    :param zone_hi: The highest zone index to consider for allocation
    :param order: The order of the pages to allocate (2^order pages)
    :param memflags: Memory allocation flags that may affect the allocation
    :param d: The domain for which to allocate memory or NULL
    :type zone_lo: unsigned int
    :type zone_hi: unsigned int
    :type order: unsigned int
    :type memflags: unsigned int
    :type d: struct domain *
    :returns: The allocated page_info structure, or NULL on failure

    This function allocates a contiguous block of pages from the heap.
    It checks claims and available memory before attempting the
    allocation. On success, it updates relevant counters and consumes
    claims as necessary.

    It first checks whether the request can be satisfied given the domain's
    claims and available memory using ``claims_permit_request()``.

    If ``MEMF_no_scrub`` is allowed, it may return unscrubbed pages. When
    that happens, ``populate_physmap()`` scrubs them if needed via hypercall
    continuation to avoid long hypercall latency and watchdog timeouts.

    Simplified pseudo-code of its logic:
.. code:: C

    struct page_info *alloc_heap_pages(unsigned int zone_lo,
                                       unsigned int zone_hi,
                                       unsigned int order,
                                       unsigned int memflags,
                                       struct domain *d) {
        /* Check whether claims and available memory permit the request.
         * `avail_pages` and `claims` are placeholders for the appropriate
         * global or node-local availability/counts used by the real code. */
        if (!claims_permit_request(d, avail_pages, claims, memflags,
                                   1UL << order, NUMA_NO_NODE))
            return NULL;

        /* Find a suitable buddy block. Pass the zone range, order and
         * memflags so the helper can apply node and zone selection. */
        pg = get_free_buddy(zone_lo, zone_hi, order, memflags, d);
        if (!pg)
            return NULL;

        consume_allocation(d, 1UL << order, node_of(pg));
        update_counters_and_stats(d, order);
        if (pg_has_dirty_pages(pg))
            scrub_dirty_pages(pg);
        return pg;
    }

get_free_buddy()
----------------

.. c:function:: struct page_info *get_free_buddy(unsigned int zone_lo, \
                                                 unsigned int zone_hi, \
                                                 unsigned int order, \
                                                 unsigned int memflags, \
                                                 const struct domain *d)

    :param zone_lo: The lowest zone index to consider for allocation
    :param zone_hi: The highest zone index to consider for allocation
    :param order: The order of the pages to allocate (2^order pages)
    :param memflags: Flags for conducting the allocation
    :param d: domain to allocate memory for or NULL
    :type zone_lo: unsigned int
    :type zone_hi: unsigned int
    :type order: unsigned int
    :type memflags: unsigned int
    :type d: struct domain *
    :returns: The allocated page_info structure, or NULL on failure

    This function finds a suitable block of free pages in the buddy
    allocator while respecting claims and node-level available memory.

    Called by :ref:`designs/claims/implementation:alloc_heap_pages()` after
    verifying the request is permissible, it iterates over nodes and zones
    to find a buddy block that satisfies the request. It checks node-local
    claims before attempting allocation from a node.

    Using :ref:`designs/claims/implementation:claims_permit_request()`,
    it checks whether the node has enough unclaimed memory to satisfy
    the request or whether the domain's claims can permit the request
    on that node after accounting for outstanding claims.

    If the node can satisfy the request, it searches for a suitable block
    in the specified zones. If found, it returns the block; otherwise it
    tries the next node until all online nodes are exhausted.

    Simplified pseudo-code of its logic:
.. code:: C

    /*
     * preferred_node_or_next_node() represents the policy to first try the
     * preferred/requested node then fall back to other online nodes.
     */
    struct page_info *get_free_buddy(unsigned int zone_lo,
                                     unsigned int zone_hi,
                                     unsigned int order,
                                     unsigned int memflags,
                                     const struct domain *d) {
        nodeid_t request_node = MEMF_get_node(memflags);

        /*
         * Iterate over candidate nodes: start with preferred node (if any),
         * then try other online nodes according to the normal placement policy.
         */
        while (there are more nodes to try) {
            nodeid_t node = preferred_node_or_next_node(request_node);
            if (!node_allocatable_request(d, node_avail_pages[node],
                                          node_outstanding_claims[node],
                                          memflags, 1UL << order, node))
                goto try_next_node;

            /* Find a zone on this node with a suitable buddy */
            for (int zone = highest_zone; zone >= lowest_zone; zone--)
                for (int j = order; j <= MAX_ORDER; j++)
                    if ((pg = remove_head(&heap(node, zone, j))) != NULL)
                        return pg;
         try_next_node:
            if (request_node != NUMA_NO_NODE && (memflags & MEMF_exact_node))
                return NULL;
            /* Fall back to the next node and repeat. */
        }
        return NULL;
    }

*******************************************
Helper functions for allocation with claims
*******************************************

For allocating memory while respecting claims, ``alloc_heap_pages()`` and
``get_free_buddy()`` use ``claims_permit_request()`` to check whether the
claims permit the request before attempting allocation. If permitted, the
allocation proceeds, and after success, ``consume_allocation()`` consumes
the claims based on the allocation.

claims_permit_request()
-----------------------

.. c:function:: bool claims_permit_request(const struct domain *d, \
                                           unsigned long avail_pages, \
                                           unsigned long claims, \
                                           unsigned int memflags, \
                                           unsigned long request, \
                                           nodeid_t node)

    :param d: domain for which to check
    :param avail_pages: pages available globally or on node
    :param claims: outstanding claims globally or on node
    :param memflags: memory allocation flags for the request
    :param request: pages requested for allocation
    :param node: node of the request or NUMA_NO_NODE for global
    :type d: const struct domain *
    :type avail_pages: unsigned long
    :type claims: unsigned long
    :type memflags: unsigned int
    :type request: unsigned long
    :type node: nodeid_t
    :returns: true if claims and available memory permit the request, \
              false otherwise.

    This function checks whether a memory allocation request can be
    satisfied given the current state of available memory and outstanding
    claims for the domain. It calculates the amount of unclaimed memory
    and determines whether it is sufficient to satisfy the request.

    If unclaimed memory is insufficient, it checks if the domain's claims
    can cover the shortfall, taking into account whether the request is
    node-specific or global.

consume_allocation()
--------------------

.. c:function:: void consume_allocation(struct domain *d, \
                                        unsigned long allocation, \
                                        nodeid_t alloc_node)

    :param d: The domain for which to consume claims
    :param allocation: The number of pages allocated
    :param alloc_node: The node on which the allocation was made
    :type d: struct domain *
    :type allocation: unsigned long
    :type alloc_node: nodeid_t

    See :doc:`consumption` for details on consuming claims after allocation.

**************************************
Offlining memory in presence of claims
**************************************

When offlining pages, Xen must ensure that available memory on a node or
globally does not fall below outstanding claims. If it does, Xen recalls
claims from domains until accounting is valid again.

This is triggered by privileged domains via the
``XEN_SYSCTL_page_offline_op`` sysctl or by machine-check memory errors.

Offlining currently allocated pages does not immediately reduce available
memory: pages are marked offlining and become offline only when freed.
Pages marked offlining will not become available again, so this does not
affect claim invariants.

However, when already free pages are offlined, free memory can drop
below outstanding claims; in that case the offlining process calls
``reserve_offlined_page()`` to offline the page.

It checks whether offlining the page would cause available memory on the
page's node, or globally, to fall below the respective outstanding claims:

- If ``node_outstanding_claims[node]`` exceeds ``node_avail_pages[node]``,
  ``reserve_offlined_page()`` calls ``release_node_claim()`` to recall claims
  on that node from domains with claims on the node of the offlined buddy
  until the claim accounting of the node is valid again.

- If total ``outstanding_claims`` exceeds ``total_avail_pages``,
  ``reserve_offlined_page()`` calls ``release_global_claims()`` to recall
  global claims from domains with global claims until global accounting
  is valid again.

This can violate claim guarantees, but it is necessary to maintain system
stability when memory must be offlined.

reserve_offlined_page()
-----------------------

.. c:function:: int reserve_offlined_page(struct page_info *head)

    :param head: The page being offlined
    :type head: struct page_info *
    :returns: 0 on success, or a negative error code on failure.

    This function is called during the offlining process to offline pages.

    If offlining a page causes available memory to fall below outstanding
    claims, it checks the node and global claim accounting and recalls
    claims from domains as necessary to ensure accounting invariants hold
    after a buddy is offlined.
