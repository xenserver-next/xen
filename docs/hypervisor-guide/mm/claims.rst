Memory Claims
=============

Overview
--------

Xen's page allocator supports a **claims** mechanism that allows a domain
builder to reserve memory before allocation begins, preventing concurrent
allocations from exhausting available pages mid-build.
A claim can be global (host-wide) or target a specific NUMA node, ensuring
that a domain's memory is allocated locally on the same node as its vCPUs.

The host-wide claims check subtracts global claims from total available pages.
If the domain has claims, its ``d->outstanding_pages`` are added back as
available (simplified pseudo-code):

.. code:: C

   ASSERT(spin_is_locked(&heap_lock));
   unsigned long global_avail = total_avail_pages - outstanding_claims
                                                    + d->outstanding_pages;
   return alloc_request <= global_avail;

Similarly, the per-node check enforces node-level claims by subtracting
outstanding node claims from available node pages, and adding back the domain's
claim if allocating from the claimed node:

.. code:: C

   ASSERT(spin_is_locked(&heap_lock));
   unsigned long avail = node_avail_pages(node)
                         - node_outstanding_claims(node)
                         + (node == d->claim_node ? d->outstanding_pages : 0);
   return alloc_request <= avail;

Simplified pseudo-code for the claims checks in the buddy allocator:

.. code:: C

    struct page_info *get_free_buddy(order, memflags, d) {
        for ( ; ; ) {
            node = preferred_node_or_next_node();
            if (!node_allocatable_request(d, memflags, 1 << order, node))
                goto try_next_node;
            /* Find a zone on this node with a suitable buddy */
            for (zone = highest_zone; zone >= lowest_zone; zone--)
                for (j = order; j <= MAX_ORDER; j++)
                    if (pg = remove_head(&heap(node, zone, j)))
                        return pg;
         try_next_node:
            if (req_node != NUMA_NO_NODE && memflags & MEMF_exact_node)
                return NULL;
            /* Fall back to the next node and repeat. */
        }
    }

    struct page_info *alloc_heap_pages(d, order, memflags) {
        if (!host_allocatable_request(d, memflags, 1 << order))
            return NULL;
        pg = get_free_buddy(order, memflags, d);
        if (!pg) /* Retry allowing unscrubbed pages */
            pg = get_free_buddy(order, memflags|MEMF_no_scrub, d);
        if (!pg)
            return NULL;
        if (pg has dirty pages)
            scrub_dirty_pages(pg);
        return pg;
    }

.. note:: The first ``get_free_buddy()`` pass skips unscrubbed pages and may
    fall back to other nodes. With ``memflags & MEMF_exact_node``, no fallback
    occurs, so the first pass may return ``NULL``.
    The 2nd pass with ``MEMF_no_scrub`` will consider the unscrubbed pages.
    ``alloc_heap_pages()`` then scrubs them before returning, guaranteeing the
    domain gets the desired node-local pages even when scrubbing is pending.

    Therefore, toolstacks should set ``MEMF_exact_node`` in ``memflags`` when
    allocating for a domain with a NUMA-aware claim to with
    ``XENMEMF_exact_node(node)``.

    For efficient scrubbing, toolstacks might want to run domain builds
    pinned on a CPU of the target NUMA node to scrub the pages on that node
    without cross-node traffic and lower latency to speed up domain build.

Data Structures
---------------

The following diagram shows the relationships between global, per-node,
and per-domain claim counters, all protected by the global ``heap_lock``.

       direction TB

       Per-node --Sum of--> Per-domain
