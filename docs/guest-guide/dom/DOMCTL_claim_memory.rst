XEN_DOMCTL_claim_memory
=======================

This **domctl** command allows a privileged domain to stake a memory claim for
a domain identical to :ref:`XENMEM_claim_pages`, but with support for
NUMA-aware memory claims.

A claim entry with a node value of ``XEN_DOMCTL_CLAIM_MEMORY_GLOBAL`` stakes
a claim for host memory, similar to :ref:`XENMEM_claim_pages`.

For this multi-claim API, the passed claims are treated as absolute
replacement targets for the domain's current claims. A new request can grow,
shrink, or move existing claims between NUMA nodes, and can combine
node-specific claims with a global host-level claim.

The legacy single global claim path remains unchanged for compatibility. Its
semantics are still derived from the delta between the requested total and the
domain's already allocated pages, and it does not gain the replacement/update
behaviour of this multi-claim API.

NUMA-aware memory claims
------------------------

Memory locality is an important factor for performance in NUMA systems.
Allocating memory close to the CPU that will use it can reduce latency
and improve overall performance.

By claiming memory on specific NUMA nodes, Xen toolstacks can ensure that
they will be able to allocate memory for the domain on those nodes. This is
particularly beneficial for workloads that are sensitive to memory latency,
such as in-memory databases.

Implementation notes
--------------------

See :ref:`hypervisor-guide` > :ref:`memory_management` > :ref:`memory_claims`
for details on the API semantics and implementation details of the claims
infrastructure of the Xen buddy allocator backing this hypercall.

Used functions & data structures

Call sequence diagram

The following sequence diagram illustrates the call flow for claiming memory
for a domain using this hypercall command from an OCaml toolstack:

Claim workflow

The following diagram illustrates a workflow for claiming and populating memory:

API example (libxc)
-------------------
The following example demonstrates how a toolstack can claim memory before
building the domain and then releasing the claim once the memory population
is complete.

Note: ``memory_claim_t`` contains padding for future expansion.
Thus, the structure must be zero-initialised to ensure forward compatibility,
C does this when using designated initializers or compound literals, but if
the structure is initialised in another way, the padding must be explicitly
zeroed to ensure forward compatibility.
