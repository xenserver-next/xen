Guest documentation
===================

Xen exposes a set of hypercalls that allow guest domains to request services
from the hypervisor. Through these hypercalls, guests can perform privileged
operations such as querying system information, memory and domain management,
and enabling inter-domain communication via shared memory and event channels.

These hypercalls are documented in the following sections, grouped by their
functionality. Each section provides an overview of the hypercalls, their
parameters, and examples of how to use them.
